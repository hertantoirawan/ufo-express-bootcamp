{"sightings":[{"text":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light. Was looking out my window and saw a orange colored, non blinking light floating across the night sky. Woke up my daughters to confirm what I was seeing. The object did not blink, was definitely not a helicopter. Very bright orange and moved slowly for about 2 minutes, disappeared behind the trees and did not see it again. Never seen anything like this in my life.","date_time":"2019-02-11 22:00:00","city":"Black Mountain","state":"NC","shape":"Fireball","duration":"2 minutes","summary":"Witnessed an orange, slow moving light.

I very quickly ran up to 2 firemen emergency responders to ask them to quote \"take a quick glance at what is going on over here\".  They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","date_time":"2019-02-10 22:00:00","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"3 minutes","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin"},{"text":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","date_time":"2019-02-12 22:00","city":"Alamo","state":"TX","shape":"Fireball","duration":"1 minute","summary":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","created_time":"2022-02-20 17:46:08"},{"text":"Chaos everywhere, people flying, cows flying","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","shape":"Sphere","duration":"2 minutes","city":"San Diego","state":"CA","summary":"Chaos everywhere, people flying, cows flying","created_time":"2022-02-23 14:49:53","updated_time":"2022-02-25 10:26:12"},{"text":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","city":"San Diego","state":"CA","shape":"Formation","duration":"1 minute","summary":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","created_time":"2022-02-23 14:50:14"},{"text":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","city":"Alamo","state":"TX","shape":"Diamond","duration":"1 minute","summary":"Blinding lights all over the place, too bright I can't even see anything","created_time":"2022-02-23 14:50:35"},{"text":"Chaos everywhere, people flying, cows flying, screaming","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","city":"Alamo","state":"TX","shape":"Boomerang","duration":"1 minute","summary":"Chaos everywhere, people flying, cows flying, screaming","created_time":"2022-02-23 14:51:42","updated_time":"2022-02-24 01:43:55"},{"text":"This is a test sighting input new data.","date_time":"2022-02-25","city":"Roswell","state":"TX","shape":"Donut","duration":"1 minute","summary":"This is a test sighting input new data.","created_time":"2022-02-25 00:45:19","updated_time":"2022-02-25 00:49:23"},{"text":"Testing another new sighting.","date_time":"2022-02-07","shape":"Saucer","duration":"3 minutes","city":"Alamo","state":"TX","summary":"Testing another new sighting.","created_time":"2022-02-25 09:15:22"},{"text":"test asd","date_time":"2022-02-03","shape":"Sphere","duration":"2 minute","city":"Roswell","state":"CA","summary":"test asd","created_time":"2022-02-25 09:54:59","updated_time":"2022-02-25 09:55:16"}]}
